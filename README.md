Some important hints to pay attention to ❤🌟

1️⃣ The image in the first section stays fixed while scrolling.
2️⃣ In the About section, there’s a dotted background behind the image.
3️⃣ Pay attention to letter spacing in the text.
4️⃣ Check the hover effect on buttons in the About section.
5️⃣ Behind each section title, there’s a background style — don’t miss it.
6️⃣ For the icons, notice the hover effect: the color changes when hovered.
7️⃣ Watch the style of the indicators in the Carousel section.
8️⃣ In the Our Team section, each hover effect is different depending on where you hover.
9️⃣ In the Contact section, the focus style on inputs looks different — take care of that.
🔟 As you scroll through sections, the active link changes in the navbar, same goes for nav and tabs.
1️⃣1️⃣ In the Portfolio section, there’s a modal with a carousel when clicking the icon. It’s not required, but worth +5 bonus points. Also, the Counter section animation gives +2 bonus points.
1️⃣2️⃣ The Loader at the beginning of the website is not required.
1️⃣3️⃣ The navbar background color changes on scroll — also not required, but gives +2 bonus points.
1️⃣4️⃣ No JavaScript libraries or JS code are allowed, except for the bonus part (changing navbar background color on scroll).
1️⃣5️⃣ Don’t forget to use the same font family, font weight, and colors.
1️⃣6️⃣ Any section that ends up with horizontal scrolling will get a zero grade — be careful with spacing.
1️⃣7️⃣ The Home section animation is mandatory.

💙 Best of luck to everyone!
